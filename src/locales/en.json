    "textAbout1": "I am a nutritionist in Rio de Janeiro, passionate about connecting science, food, and memories. In my travel recipe book, I bring together stories, world flavors, and a light approach to eating. My mission is to show that healthy weight loss is not built on restrictive diets, but on smart choices that care for both the gut microbiota and the relationship with food. Between consultations, writing, and watercolors, I have created a space dedicated to those seeking more health, balance, and pleasure at the table.",
